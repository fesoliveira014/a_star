# A* Implementation

This is an A* implementation I did in my spare time. It requires C++11 in order to run. 

This implemetation works for 2D grids and uses the Manhattan Distance heuristic. Note that it was made in a way that the heuristics is detached from the algorithm, so it can be changed if required.
